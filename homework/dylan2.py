# First we need to import everything we need from the Game engine (a module called 'advent'):

# HOMEWORK STARTS HERE

# 1. Open items_list.txt and keep it open next to this file.
# 2. Use the locations in items_list.txt to
#    Write 2 new object commands (1 ball, 1 key)
#          1 make required commands (key required to open office door)
#          1 add phrase commands (bounce ball)
