        ued by Thetis and Eurynome who raised in a cave on the shores of the River Okeanos where he became a skilled smith, which is a metal worker. Angry at his mothers treatment, Hephaisto
        s sent various gifts to Olympus including a Golden Throne for Hera. When the goddess Hera sat upon this cursed throne she was strictly injured. 
        Ares Love: Zeus looked for the assistance of the gods so he could free his Queen and offered the goddess Aphrodite in marriage to the god who could bring Hephaestus to Olympus. Aphrodite
        agreed to the arrangement in the belief that her beloved Ares would prevail.""")
